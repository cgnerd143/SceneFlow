## ✨ Features

✅ **Scene-Aware Object List Management**  
Add objects to a custom list from selection or by name, and manage them independently of Blender’s native collection system.

✅ **Powerful Visibility Controls**  
Quickly `Hide`, `Unhide`, `Isolate`, `Restore`, and `Delete` objects — either from the list or current selection.

✅ **Text-Based Import / Export**  
Save and load object lists with `.txt` files to simplify scene setup reuse and shareability.

✅ **Auto Export Support**  
Enable auto-saving of the current list when making changes — great for collaborative workflows or keeping backups.

✅ **Undo & Redo Integration**  
All actions respect Blender’s native Undo system (`Ctrl+Z`), so you can explore freely without risk.

✅ **Clean Sidebar UI**  
Organized into intuitive panels:
- 🎛 List Controls  
- 🧲 Selected Object Controls  
- ℹ️ About Panel with quick access to support & documentation

## 🔧 Installation

1. Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/cgnerd143/SceneFlow/releases)
2. In Blender: **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install**
3. Select the `.zip`, click **Install Add-on**, and enable **SceneFlow**

## 🧠 Tips & Notes

- `Isolate / Restore` are temporary view modes, not undoable (like Blender's Local View).
- Use `Unhide All` (or `Alt+H`) to reveal everything after isolating.
- Great for animation prep, layout, lookdev, and cluttered scene cleanup.
